# regime-information
Working with regime data in R primarily for the purpose of developing explanatory variables for use in other projects. Polity V, VDem, Archigos, etc.

This is basically a working directory that I use for cleaning data, merging datasets, creating variables, etc. Many of these things are work in progress, so proof before using.

The original datasets are not uploaded, but should be identifiable by the filenames in the scripts. As of now, July 2020, any dataset I used in this repo is a freely available dataset easily found online unless otherwise noted.

There is little if any original theory or research here.
